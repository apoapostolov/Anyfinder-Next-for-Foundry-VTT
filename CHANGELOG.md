## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Made gridless pathfinding fail closed: while no verified route exists, Anyfinder now returns only the exact origin and prevents release from moving the token into the first wall.
- Removed the remaining gridless fallbacks to Foundry's partial straight-line constraint result during Worker waits, cached failures, solver failures, and exceptions.
- Refused cached gridless routes whose destination no longer matches the current pointer, preventing release onto a stale partial route.
- Restored Foundry v14's required first-waypoint contract for gridless paths: Worker, synchronous, and cached routes now remain anchored to the exact token drag origin.
- Stopped using movement history as the gridless solver origin and stopped stripping the origin from completed Worker routes.
- Corrected gridless coordinate handling so Foundry token positions are converted to movement origins before routing and generated nodes are converted back before movement.
- Added an authoritative final safety gate through Foundry's own movement constraint; a route Foundry would shorten or alter is now rejected instead of leaving the token at a collision point.
- Kept hard wall corners protected by endpoint exclusion during node search and final segment validation, with a regression fixture for joined right-angle walls.
- Retired the ineffective minimum-clearance pixel rule from routing and hid its legacy setting.
- Migrated normal Anyfinder's v14 lifecycle, option-normalization, and fast-drag Worker tolerance fixes.
- Corrected the five-argument v14 WASM pathfinding call and restored cancellation.
- Invalidated gridless graphs and Worker results on wall, scene, and clearance-setting changes.
- Rejected stale Worker answers using scene/settings fingerprints and current-wall collision checks.
- Added one bounded first-request bootstrap solve to avoid an initial straight route while the Worker is cold.
- Validated the implicit start connector and permit only same-side, clearance-increasing egress for wall-adjacent starts.
- Prevented main-thread diagonal corner cutting and removed duplicate undirected graph-edge checks.
- Enforced Worker time limits that were previously declared but unused.
- Hid Foundry's temporary direct dashed segment while Anyfinder is calculating the real route.
- Kept long gridless searches pending until their matching Worker result arrives instead of losing successful late results to a native fallback.
- Added route-focused search windows, spatial wall indexing, fine-resolution retries, and larger off-thread budgets for large complex maps.
- Reworked squeeze clearance as a token-relative 60%-diameter rule, enabled it by default, and added final Worker collision validation so token centers cannot cross walls.

### Added

- Preserved the installed normal Anyfinder v14 module under `ingest/anyfinder` for comparison.
- Added gridless Worker and integration regression tests.
- Added a complete pathfinding audit and gridless node/A* design study.

## [14.0.1] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- If a wall is not assigned to any level it will now count as being on all levels which is intended according to Foundry.

## [14.0.0] - 2026-04-13

This is an update to add support for Foundry Version 14, there is no backwards compatibility. One thing to note is that Foundry doesn't provide a means to drag a token from one level to another, it has to be done either through regions or manually changing which level a token is on. It is possible to control tokens on another level and Wayfinder will make sure that those tokens avoid walls on their level. However, Fog Exploration is only available for the currently active level so if you are restricting movement based on it then tokens on another level will not be able to move into areas that are explored on their level that aren't explored on the active level.

## [13.1.1] - 2026-04-10

### Changed

- Adjusted the order in which neighboring nodes are returned, they are sorted using the rectilinear distance to the goal so nodes closest to the goal should be processed first

## [13.1.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- 4th Dimensional Navigation
  - When attempting to find a path it will now generate and walk from the current node to the goal, if this path is valid and doesn't run into any walls or enter unexplored parts of the map it will treat the goal as being "next" to the current node with the actual cost to move down the path as the cost of moving to the goal. That means if it thinks there is a cheaper route it will try and follow that first, but if it ends up costing the same as the direct path it will use that.

### Changed

- When the Grid Diagonal Rule is set to Exact it will instead treat it as Approximate, this doesn't change anything on Foundry's side but just changes how Wayfinder calculates the cost which allows me to do the next bit.
- Costs are now in a "decimal" format, so instead of using a normal floating point numeric that can lose precision it nows uses a fixed decimal that doesn't lose precision as easly. Meaning `0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3` instead of `0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004`. With the new changes above we only need 2-4 decimals of precision which doesn't get lost.

## [13.0.3] - 2026-04-02

### Changed

- When getting neighboring nodes, return nodes that don't require diagonal movement first before returning ones that do require diagonal movement

## [13.0.2] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- FogManager now accounts for the "scale" of the fog sprite when attempting to extract the exploration data

## [13.0.1] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed

- Fixed a typo that prevented Wayfinder from getting the fog of war properly

## [13.0.0] - 2026-03-31

This is pretty much a complete re-write of the Rust side of things in order to make the module not dependent on a specific system.

## [7.1.0] - 2025-06-20

### Changed

- Reworked Fog Exploration
  - Due to a [bug](https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/13046) with `FogManager` the way Wayfinder handles fog exploration needed to be reworked.
  - It will now generate a texture that represents the explored area and use that to calculate if a spot has been "explored". This is similar to how it used to work but instead of extracting all four channels (red, green, blue, and alpha) it only extracts the red channel. It is also done less often now, it used to be done every time Wayfinder was trying to find a path and now it's only done when the canvas is ready or when the explored area has changed.

### Fixed

- Wayfinder now respects if you have pathfinding disabled

## [7.0.0] - 2025-06-17

Foundry Virtual Tabletop - Version 13 Support!

### Added

- Support for the new Token Ruler

### Changed

- Project Refactorization

### Removed

- Difficult Terrain Support (This will need to be readded by the PF2e System)
- Action Icons (This will need to be implemented by the PF2e System)

## [6.8.1] - 2024-12-13

### Fixed

- Fixed a problem where Sequencer appears to be changing PixiJS GLTexture Index

## [6.8.0] - 2024-12-13

### Added

- Added they Wayfinder object (`canvas.wayfinder`) to the canvas
  - This is created when the canvas is ready and stores information about the current scene such as the bounds, grid, and walls. When the canvas is torn down the memory is freed and the object is cleared.
- Wall creation, deletion, or updates are passed to the Wayfinder object
  - This is used to keep the stored data about the walls for collision detection up to date.
- Added [QuadTree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree)
  - This is a bit complicated to explain but it's an efficient way to store objects in 2D space and allows you to retrieve objects in a certain region without checking every object, this is used to store information about the walls for collision detection.
- If someone is using Wayfinder to find a path while moving a token, the full path is now transmitted

### Changed

- Changed data from f32 to f65 to match JavaScript's Number
- The explored texture is passed to the Wayfinder object to read the pixel data in WebAssembly space
  - This is to prevent reading the data in JavaScript space and then passing the raw data to WebAssembly space which can be slow.
- Collision detection is handled in the same fashion as Foundry now
  - It's a single test from the center of the token to the center of where the token will be when moved. This does mean that tokens that take up more than one grid can probably pass through smaller pathways but these are "valid" moves according to Foundry for the time being.
- If you are using the regular ruler to measure distances, Wayfinder will not interfere in any way now

### Removed

- Removed Physics Engine - Reduces WebAssembly from 256 KB to 99.9 KB

## [6.7.2] - 2024-11-05

### Added

- Added known module conflicts.

### Changed

- Action icons will only display if the grid's scale is set to 5 ft.

## [6.7.1] - 2024-11-05

### Added

- Added a custom font that is used for the action icons.

### Fixed

- A problem with it locking up when trying to move a create with 0 land speed.

## [6.7.0] - 2024-11-04

### Added

- Action Icons, when enabled an icon will be display when moving a token that represents how many strides it will cost based on the token's land speed.
- Difficult Terrain, when enabled it will show the cost of moving through difficult terrain. (Does not impact pathfinding at the moment)
- Movement History, when enabled it will keep track of a token's movement during combat and reset at the start of the token's turn. (Only works with tokens in the encounter tracker at the moment)
  - The GM can reset a token's movement history by right-clicking the combatant in the encounter tracker and selecting the `Clear Movement History` option. If you are using PF2e HUD's encounter tracker press `Ctrl` to find this option.

## [6.6.1] - 2024-10-21

### Fixed

- Oops, mixed up X/Y coordinates as X/X coordinates

## [6.6.0] - 2024-10-21

### Changed

- Pathfinding toggle is now a compass
- When adding a waypoint the entire found path will be added as multiple waypoints

### Fixed

- Make sure found path is properly snapped to the grid
- Fixed a problem with checking fog exploration where it was slightly off when checking pixels
- Improved Fog Exploration
